Problem statement: There are numerous job search websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc. but these websites are geared towards a job-listing search approach i.e. search for a role → view company → apply job.

WorkPerk was geared towards individuals who prioritise culture and benefits, leading to an alternative approach i.e. select cultures and benefits → view company → apply job.
