	            <h3 data-filter-by="text">Hi, my name is Shaz.</h3>
	            <p>Let me tell you my story. Right out of university with a computing degree, I became a software developer at a startup. I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to immediately push a few pages into production by the end of the first week. It was everything I ever wanted - be part of a startup, be part of building an awesome product and practising my programming skills so that one day I get to build my own startup.</p>
	            <p>However, I quickly found myself feeling unhappy as the days went by. I couldn't put a pin on the exact reason why but that led me to quitting in the second week. A quick but an incomplete reflection on my experience made me come to the conclusion that maybe programming as a job wasn't my thing. In my haste, I applied and secured a job in IT consulting. I figured I still wanted to be in the technology scene and this path could still lead me to running my own startup in the future.</p>
	            <p>It took me quite awhile to realise the reason I became unhappy at my first job was simply a lack of culture-fit. There was the hidden expectation that I was to spend longer hours at work. This may sound silly but I was also highly discouraged of spending lunch time with the engineering department and not anyone else. I recall proposing coming to work at 7am to prolong my working hours. I just couldn't fit into the company culture.</p>
	            <p>This gave me enough motivation to start WorkPerk. There's a reason why culture is so important. One has to feel happy in order to produce the best work. The goal is to showcase each company's values, cultures and perks.</p>
	            <p>This is a continuous work in progress so if there's anything I am doing wrong or could do better, let me know right away. If you're in Singapore and would love a cup of coffee (or tea, or bandung) with me, I'd be down for that too.</p>
